# Welcome to Mokku V2

Mokku v2 is written from scratch following the sample principle but improved UI and ease to use.

- Divide Mocks into project
- Create GraphQL Mocks
- Modify Headers on the go!
- Better Mock editing, uses the Monaco editor, the VSCode editor.
- Write function for mocks (Beta)
- Data Remains local
- No login Required
- Free forever
- Mokku core (extensions), is still and will always be open source

We have created a offline org and Project for you where all your previous mocks exist.

### Why I am seeing an web app?

This helps in the separation of concerns and allow faster updates.
Mock extensions now just contains the code for mocking the api calls and showing the result in panel as before.

### Where is my data?

Your data will remain in chrome near you! This app is just frontend, there are no servers managing data.

### Will there be Cloud version?

Yes there will be cloud version, but local version is not going anywhere! You will always have a choice. To choose Cloud or local.

We advice is local version, if you are working alone. Cloud version is meant for teams.

### How many organization I can create

For now only 1.

### How many projects I can create

You can create up to 5 projects.
